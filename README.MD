# Ski boot sole canting 

![Screenshot](plates.png)

### Ski boot canting system for ISO standard ski boots. Height normalized for plate interchangeability. 

Use with 3mm or 5mm treaded lifters (provided). In case one boot requires canting and the other does not, use the 0deg_normal lifter to maintain stack height (Heluvaskier's idea). Open the .step file to create custom plates from a template. Boot lugs must be routed back to DIN spec.

## 3d printing instructions
Print the treaded lifters in something strong. I prefer CF nylon or CF PC, 100% density (the lifters can easily last a season). Canted plates can be printed in PLA, but I prefer using the tougher material.  

I have tried engineering resin (siraya-tech blue + tenacious), however these resins become brittle in the cold and will crack (even at 100% tenacious). FDM is the way to go for this application.
